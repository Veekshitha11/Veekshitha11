## Hi, I'm Veekshitha 👋

I'm a CS student starting my open-source journey.

### What I'm focusing on
- Learning how real open-source projects work
- Making meaningful contributions (not just forks)
- Preparing for open-source internships (Outreachy, etc.)

### Current work
- Contributing to open-source through FOSSASIA (Codeheat)
- Improving my Git, GitHub, and collaboration skills

### Tech I'm comfortable with
- Java
- Python
- Git & GitHub

I'm here to learn, contribute, and grow in public.
